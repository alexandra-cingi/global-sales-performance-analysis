# global-sales-performance-analysis
This report summarises the findings of data analysis conducted on the GlobalMart dataset between 2012 and 2015. The objective was to identify growth trends, evaluate regional performance, and assess the relationship between sales volume and profitability, in order to provide strategic recommendations for the future.

The line graph revealed a consistent upward trajectory in global sales over the four-year period. However, significant seasonality is evident, with pronounced peaks in the fourth quarter (October to December). This suggests that GlobalMart is heavily reliant on holiday-season demand, creating a high-pressure operational period at the end of each year.

While the Western Europe and North America regions lead in total sales volume, they do not always lead in profits. The analysis of profit margins revealed that several high-volume regions are actually operating on thin margins. Conversely, certain other markets contribute to lower total sales but significantly higher profit margins.

The heat map shows that Technology and Furniture are the primary drivers of high-value transactions. However, Office Supplies maintains a consistent volume across all global regions. Additionally, from the scatter plot it appeared that while Furniture generates high revenue, it is also associated with the highest frequency of loss-making transactions, potentially due to high delivery costs of bulky items, or heavy discounts.

A recommendation for GlobalMart could be to look into the operational costs of the highest-selling regions. If the profit margin is narrow despite the high sales, maybe they could investigate logistics expenses, or any other costs such as local promotional strategies that may be eroding the profits.

Furthermore, to mitigate the risks associated with the extreme seasonality, GlobalMart could introduce mid-year promotional campaigns, or even loyalty discounts in quarters 2 and 3. Reducing the "valley" between the "peaks" will also improve cash flow and warehouse efficiency.

Finally, given the significant number of negative-profit transactions, which look to be caused mainly by the Furniture category, GlobalMart might want to review delivery costs and/or discounts for bulky items. Also, shifting the focus toward Technology and Office Supplies in regions with high logistics costs could protect future profitability.
